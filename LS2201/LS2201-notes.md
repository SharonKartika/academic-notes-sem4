- Organisms have the capacity to over reproduce
- Organisms are enormously variable in their traits
- Struggle for existence
- Environmental factors filter heritable variations
- Those best adapted will produce higher number of offspring

__Fitness__: the number of offspring that reproduce. 

If an adaptive advantage is heritable, this leads to differential fitness.

Myxoma virus wiped out 90% of the rabbit population in 1950, but in 10 years the problem resurfaced. 

__Variation__: difference in a given trait among organisms of the same species.

In humans, attached ear lobes are inherited as a dominant trait.

Other examples include: ability to roll the tongue, blood groups, curved little finger.

__Mutation__: Sudden heritable change in genetic material. The source of genetic variation. The effects range from minor alterations to lethal alleles.

Mutations that don't change the protein product are called __isoalleles.__ Others may result in total loss of gene activity.

__Somatic mutations__: not transmitted to offspring.

__Germline mutations__: possibly transmitted to offspring.

__Spontaneous mutations__ result from random errors in DNA replication, at a rate of 1 in 100,000 nucleotide pairs.

__Proboscis monkey__: elongated nose gave 

_Enzyme polymorphism_: 5% of enzyme loci are heterozygous.

_DNA polymorphism_: DNA sequences may vary even if the enzyme products are the same.

_Allele_ is a state of a locus. One or more alternate state of a gene.

__Allele frequency__: measure of occurrence of of an allele in a population. 

## Hardy-weinberg equilibrium

If we are given the allele frequencies, we can calculate the genotypic frequencies. Let $p$ and $q$ be the frequency of dominant black allele $B$ and recessive white allele $b$. 
$$
p+q=1
$$
The probability of an individual having $BB$ phenotype will then be 
$$
P(BB)=p\cdot p=p^2
$$
and similarly for $bb$. For $Bb$, the probability will be,
$$
P(Bb) = p\cdot q+q\cdot p
$$
This analysis makes several assumptions:

- No mutation takes place.
- No immigration or emigration takes place
- Random mating occurs
- Population size is very large
- No selection occurs. 

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principle states that a population's allele frequencies and genotypic frequencies do not change, if the above 5 criteria are satisfied. 

Algorithm:

1. Calculate the phenotypic frequencies from whatever data is given.
2. From this we calculate the genotypic frequencies and then the phenotypic frequencies to see if the expected genotypic frequencies are observed; in which case, we conclude that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 

The factors that can cause real populations to diverge from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are:

- Mutation
- Non-random mating
- Gene flow
- Genetic drift
- Natural selection.

#### Non random mating

In self fertilizing plants, it is observed that the frequency of heterozygotes are lower than that predicted by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 

Mating with a genetically related individual can cause the expression of recessive genes, which can decrease the offspring viability.

__Genetic drift__: random changes in allele frequency.

__Founder effect__: change in allele frequencies caused by a few individuals. 

__Bottleneck effect__: drastic reduction in population size.

## Selection

Three major types:

1. Directional selection: selects at one end of the spectrum.
2. Disruptive or Diversifying selection: at both ends.
3. Stabilizing selection: disfavors both ends.

Infant birthweight is an example of a phenotype that undergoes stabilising selection. The mortality increases on both sides of the spectrum.

#### Frequency dependence

Sometimes the fitness of a trait can depend on the frequency of that trait in the population. It can be a negative or a positive dependence. In negative dependence, rare traits are favored. 

__Secondary sex characteristics__: features that distinguish two sexes of the species other than the reproductive system.

Expensive displays express vitality and super abundance. 

The goal of every organism is to increase the number of offspring that themselves reproduce.

__Intrasexual selection__: direct competition among individuals within a species. Usually male skewed: reproductive success of males is variable whereas not so for females.

__Epigamic selection__: Mate choice. One sex chooses a mate from the opposite sex.

Why are females usually the choosers? Because it is females that invest more in child rearing. 

## Speciation

__Allopatric__: geographically isolated.

__Sympatric__: same place.

_Peripatric speciation_ is a special case of allopatric speciation, where one of the isolated population is so few in number that a founder's  effect is observed.
