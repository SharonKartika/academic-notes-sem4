## Structure of earth

Strength: lithosphere, asthenosphere, mesosphere.

Chemistry: crust, mantle core.

Lithosphere is crust + upper mantle.

### Lithosphere

Strong boundary layer. Conductive heat loss

### Asthenosphere

Mechanically weak. Underlying layer. Convective heat loss.

### Lithosphere asthenosphere boundary LAB

see last page of __slide 1.__

### P wave

Longitudinal

### S wave

Transverse

The travel time curves at different places indicates a density discontinuity.

We define __CRUST | _MOHO_ | MANTLE__

### Crust

Oceanic: 7-8km.

Continental: 35km.

### Gutenberg discont

Mantle- core boundary.

Surface waves nonexistent in outer core due to no rigidity.

### Low velocity zone

Creates a discontinuity in the travel-time plot. Much delayed PKP arrival indicates slower p-wave velocity in the outer core.

### Lehmann discont

Outer core - inner core



# L2

### Tectonics

1. good fit south america africa
2. plant and fossils now separated by oceans
3. climate change on continents
   - Coal in antartica
   - fossil fern in polar region
   - glacial deposit in africa

Wegener stated that continents plowed through the ocean floor.

Lithosphere is divided into nearly rigid _plates_ move over asthenosphere.

#### Divergent boundary

Accreting or constructive plate boundary.Normal fault mechanism.

Shallow focus earthquakes.

#### convergent boundary

Consuming or destructive boundary. Represents trench. Subducts upto 700km.

Deep focus earthquakes.

#### Conservative boundary

Transform fault. No destruction or construction. strike slip fault mechanism.

Shallow focus. 

Eg: san andreas. Dextral (Or __RIGHT LATERAL__). 5cm y^-1^.

> Only the oceanic part of a plate is created/destroyed.



# L3

Spherical geometry

The displacement of plates can be represented as motion with respect to a pole. 
$$
v=\omega R\sin \theta
$$
__Positive__ if anti-clockwise from outside.

> Latitudes are positive in the north
>
> Longitudes are positive in the east

If convergent on one side of ride, divergent on the other.

### Triple junction

Stable if, Relative motions, and azimuth remains same. Configuration does not change.

### What drives the plates

Ridge push slab pull.





# Gravity

$$
a(\theta_1+\theta_2)=d
$$

$d$ is the separation.

$a$ is the radius of the earth.

But expected deflection due to the himalaya was higher than the actual.

#### Isostacy 

a lack of mass to account for the reduced deflection.

### two hypothesis

#### Airy: mass

#### Pratt: density

Assume that the earth is a sphere and the density depends only on the depth.

potential at $P$ of a spherical shell is given by,
$$
V=\frac{-G}{r}\rho t4\pi b^2
$$
Which is the same as the potential due to a point mass with the same mass as the shell.

But, inside the shell,
$$
-G\rho t 4\pi b=\text{constant}
$$
Thus, the acceleration inside will be zero, which is the negative gradient. 

> Thus, the material outside of a body inside earth will not contribute to its acceleration.

### Polar flattening

A measure of the ellipticity.
$$
f=R_e-R_p)/R_e
$$
and,
$$
r=R_e(1-f\sin^2\lambda)
$$

### Rotation

It decreases the acceleration due to gravity.
$$
g=g'-\omega^2R\sin^2\lambda
$$
Taking both the effects into account we can write,
$$
g(\lambda)=g_e(1+\alpha\sin^2\lambda+\beta\sin^4\lambda)
$$
Deviation from static sphere is 40% due to shape and rest due to shape.

#### Geoid 

Equipotential surfaces. The levels of the ocean will be the geoid. 

When we hand a pendulum, it will be in the direction perpendicular to the geoid. 

#### Reference Oblate spheroid

The equipotential due to this is used as a model geoid. The difference is called the __geoid height anomaly__. 

To move in a geoid, we will not have to do any work. 

Around 100m high anomaly exist in the indian ocean. 
$$
R_{geoid}-R_{reference} = \Delta h 
$$
Mass excess causes $\Delta h$ to be positive. 

### Gravity measurements

Using a gravimeter. Can be absolute or relative.



#### Corrections

##### Free air correction

Reduce the measured value to the Reference spheroid (Datum).

If the measurement is made at a height $h$ with the reference spheroid, 
$$
g(h)=g_0\left(1-\frac{2h}{R}\right)
$$
or,
$$
g_0-g(h)=\frac{2h}{R}=\delta g_F
$$
Also called the free air correction. Larger the $h$ larger the anomaly. $\delta g_F$ must be _added_ to the observation for a fair comparison with the R.S. _i,e_,
$$
g_{obs}-g(\lambda)+\delta g_F
$$
Why _free air_? because we are ignoring the mass of the mountain. ($g(\lambda)$ is the gravity using theoretical calculations).

Now, if this term is non zero, it indicates that there is some other anomaly present. This gives us an idea of what is present in the subsurface. 

##### Bouguer correction

$$
\delta g_B = 2\pi G\rho h
$$

Due to the excess mass. Since an addition is created due to the mass, we need to subtract from the previous value. 
$$
g_{bouguer}=g_{obs}-g(\lambda)+\delta g_F-\delta g_B +\delta g_T
$$
The $\delta g_T$ term comes due to our assumption that there is an infinite slab, which really isnt. So we need to do a _Terrain correction_. 

#### Anomalies

Deviations of the observation and the theoretical measurement.
